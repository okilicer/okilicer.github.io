                    <p>Dr. Orsan Kilicer is a recent Ph.D. graduate from the Department of Mathematics, Texas A&M University. His academic interests include scientific computing, applied mathematics, and deep learning.</p>

                <h3 class="spaced-section">Research Interests</h3>
                <p>I conduct research in the following areas:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scientific Computing (Finite Element Method, Numerical Linear Algebra)</li>
                    <li>Applied Mathematics</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning</strong> â€“ particularly Deep Learning (as a hobby, curiosity, and long-term aspiration)</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                    My primary research focuses on the Stokes equation on surfaces and its numerical solutions using the Finite Element Method (FEM).
                </p>

                <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                    I am also passionate about solving real-world problems through Machine Learning. To support this goal, I have earned the AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Machine Learning Specialization certifications. I am actively involved in Kaggle competitions where I aim to achieve the best results with minimal computation and time costs.
                </p>

                <p class="spaced-paragraph">
                    As a committed researcher, I am confident in my ability to solve complex problems across academia and industry.
                </p>

                <h3 class="spaced-section">Graduation & Availability</h3>
                <p>
                    I graduated in May 2025. My OPT application was submitted on April 4, and I am expected to be available to start working on July 6, 2025.
